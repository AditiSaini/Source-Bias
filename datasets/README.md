# Dataset

+ [SciFact](https://allenai.org/data/scifact) dataset aims to retrieve evidence from the research literature containing scientific paper abstracts for fact-checking. 
+ [NQ320K](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions) is based on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset from Google, where the documents are gathered from Wikipedia pages, and the queries are natural language questions. 

Due to the space limitation of Github, we only upload the SciFact datasets for easliy reproducing our experiments. We will upload NQ320K dataset to Google Drive or other shared space for downloading soon.
